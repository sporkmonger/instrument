== Description

Instrument is a simple library for producing dynamically generated "controls"
with various templating languages.

== Features

* Generate controls with Erb, Haml, Markaby, or XML Builder.  Instrument
  doesn't care what template language you prefer.
* Output XHTML, XML, or JSON.  Instrument doesn't care what your output
  format is.

  will need the Haml library installed.  Same goes for any of the other
  template languages.
